# 📄 A brief introduction to the data
The data is from IMDb, a website that records information about every movie and series. The dataset contains the top 250 Tv Shows, each with details such as title, rating, release year,gener and show description. You can take a look at the [IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/?ref_=nv_tvv_250)<br>

# 🛠 Used Tools
I used Power BI to analyze and visualize the data.I imported the data with Power BI through the get data from the web feature. We can use it from (Home >> Get Data >> Web). This feature allows you to import data from a web page and load additional data from Kaggle. By modeling this data, including information from the IMDb page, I can leverage different tables to gain valuable insights.
